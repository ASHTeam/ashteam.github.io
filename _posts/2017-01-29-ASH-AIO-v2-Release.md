title: ASH AIO v2 Release
---

Hyped, aren't you?

Recently, the ASH Team has been working on v2.0 of ASH AIO. Because of all of the hacks we have, we could no longer use Python for the AIO.
So we switched to C#.

The AIO has been rewritten in C# and will be the only version of the AIO that the ASH Team will provide support/updates for.

The Python ASH AIO is now deprecated.

Download ASH AIO v2 [here](https://github.com/ASHTeam/ash-aio-2/releases/latest) and view the source code [here](https://github.com/ASHTeam/ash-aio-2/)

Enjoy!
